# Miles to Kilometer Converter Project 
This simple Python GUI program allows users to convert miles to kilometers using a graphical interface built with Tkinter.

## Functionality

- **Input**: Users can input the number of miles they want to convert into the provided entry field.
- **Conversion**: Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the program converts the input miles into kilometers using the conversion formula: `km = miles * 1.609`. The result is then displayed in the corresponding label.
- **Graphical Interface**: The program provides a user-friendly graphical interface with labeled entry fields, buttons, and result displays.
- **Validation**: The program ensures that the user inputs valid numerical values for miles. It handles non-numeric inputs gracefully.
- **Clear Display**: The kilometer result label is initialized with a default value of 0. After each conversion, it updates to display the calculated kilometers. 

## How to Use

1. Enter the number of miles you want to convert into the provided entry field.
2. Click the "Calculate" button.
3. The equivalent distance in kilometers will be displayed in the result label.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included in standard Python distributions)

## Getting Started
